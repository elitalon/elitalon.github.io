Hi! My name is Eliezer.

I am a software engineer, working most of the times with iOS. I helped create [Cloquo](https://twitter.com/cloquo), [Fintonic](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/fintonic-tus-finanzas-personales./id672220319?mt=8), [Sandbox](https://twitter.com/sandbox_network) and [Numbrs](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/centralway-numbrs/id652918824?mt=8). When I am not coding, you can find me running, playing the guitar or improving my snowboarding skills. I used to go scuba diving a lot when I was still living in [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) (did I mention I am originally from there?). Now I can only do it from time to time.

If you want to get in touch, [Twitter]({{ site.social_media.twitter }}) is the best way to reach me. If you would like to get notified when I publish a new article, you can subscribe to [my RSS feed]({{ site.feed_url }}).

# About This Site
I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this site and I am very happy with it. The layout and overall design is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), a wonderful template made by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo). I tried [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) before and I liked it. But I did not want to spend too much time fighting HTML and CSS.

I write the articles in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with some plug-ins for syntax highlighting and pagination. The [source code](https://github.com/elitalon/elitalon.github.io) is available on GitHub and published through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to <a href="{{ site.license.source }}/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a>.

Thanks for reading!
