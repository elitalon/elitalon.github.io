Hi! My name is Eliezer.

I'm a software engineer from the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¨, but I live in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ since 2014.

I work mostly as a backend and iOS developer, but I like to dabble in other fields. I helped create [Cloquo](https://web.archive.org/web/20140712053035/https://my.cloquo.com/), [Fintonic](https://www.fintonic.com/), [Sandbox](http://sandbox.is), [Numbrs](https://web.archive.org/web/20160527014416/https://www.centralway.com/de/), [GPX](https://web.archive.org/web/20170903231051/https://www.fifatms.com/gpx/), [SBB Mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237), among others.

I'm currently employed at [FAIRTIQ](https://fairtiq.com), working on our backend and helping with [our iOS apps](https://apps.apple.com/developer/fairtiq-ag/id1094360402).

When I'm not working you can find me running, playing guitar, snowboarding or swimming. I used to go scuba diving a lot, but now I can only do it from time to time.

If you want to get in touch, [Mastodon]({{ site.social_media.mastodon }}) is currently the best way to reach me. If you'd like to get notified when I publish a new article, subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ site.feed_url }}).

Thanks for reading!
