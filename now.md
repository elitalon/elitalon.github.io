📚 [_Thinking in Systems_](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/).

📺 The second half of [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series))'s seventh season is here, but in the meantime I finished [Snowpiercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer_(TV_series)).

🎧 [Las Letras Ya No Importan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Letras_Ya_No_Importan), [Yesterwynde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterwynde) and [Octavarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavarium).

🤓 The plan to turn one of our rooms into a hybrid office, guest room and recording studio slowed down a bit. The next step will probably be getting a folding bed.

🏋🏻 Back to strength work, swimming and running in preparation for the winter season 🏂. Organising the trip to the Dolomites is being trickier than I thought.
