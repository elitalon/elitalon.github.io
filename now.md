## 📚 Reading
Almost done with [Thinking in Systems](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/). With every new chapter, the book gets more and more interesting.

## 🎧 Listening
I'm having a blast listening to Dream Theater's [Parasomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasomnia_(album)), the first release after Mike Portnoy rejoined the band. _Dead Asleep_ and _Bend the Clock_ are so far my favourite songs in the album.

## 🏂 Sports
Winter season continues. Despite catching the flu first and a cold one month later, I've managed to have some good snowboarding days. And hopefully more to come.
