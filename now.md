📚 I started reading [_Línea de Fuego_](https://www.perezreverte.com/libro/748/linea-de-fuego/) right after finishing [_Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams_](https://www.pearson.ch/shop/weiterbildung/peopleware-productive-projects-and-teams-9780321934116).


📺 While I wait for the final season of [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)), I'm casually watching [Kleo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleo) and [Shahmaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahmaran_(TV_series)). Having sold my TV still feels like a smart move.


🎧 I'm revisiting [Enrique Bunbury's work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Bunbury#Studio_albums) before Greta Garbo and also Haken's [The Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_(Haken_album)).

🤓 The plan to turn one of our rooms into a hybrid office/recording studio/guest room goes well. The new chair already arrived and we have a pretty good idea about the desk and a folding bed. I'm still undecided on the monitors, although a pair of [LYD 7](https://dynaudio.com/professional-audio/lyd/lyd-7) is slightly ahead 💸

🏋🏻 Still focused on strength work at the gym until the summer passes and I can get back to my regular running outdoors training.
