📚 [_Línea de Fuego_](https://www.perezreverte.com/libro/748/linea-de-fuego/).


📺 While I wait for the final season of [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)), I'm casually watching [Kleo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleo).


🎧 [Las Letras Ya No Importan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Letras_Ya_No_Importan), [Yesterwynde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterwynde) and [Wish You Were Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)).

🤓 The plan to turn one of our rooms into a hybrid office/recording studio/guest room goes well. The next step will probably be getting a folding bed.

🏋🏻 Made a pause on strength work, and regular training overall, to enjoy playing futsal with friends and swimming in the Atlantic. On the side I'm planning the snowboarding season, which includes a trip to the Dolomites.
