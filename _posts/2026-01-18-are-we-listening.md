title: Are we listening?

<!--more-->

As a teenager, in the late 90s, I used to spend hours at the beach or the park with my friends, often talking nonsense, but sometimes also sharing things that one way or another were important to us. When one of us said something that we didn’t fully agree with, there was no urge to jump in and refute. We would tease each other and make jokes, but there wasn't any big contention, let alone malice.

I experienced something similar while I was living in Prague as part of my Erasmus exchange. On Thursdays, we used to sit in a [bar](https://web.archive.org/web/20131106221145/http://www.hospodauvocka.cz/) for hours with our Czech mates and talk freely without any major confrontation. And if there ever was any, we would solve it with a round of [Bozkov](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuzemsk%C3%BD_rum) shots and laughter.

Years later, the same scenario happened with my bandmates when I was working part-time as a musician on the weekends. We would sit down together in the hours before the show and talk about different things without the impulse to manifest one’s opinion at all cost.

I’m surely being romantic about those times, but these days it seems like there’s little space for speaking without entering a debate. It's not that before, people couldn't say what they thought or disagree with something. It's more about how often or strongly that happens nowadays.

In many conversations, as soon as one person speaks, someone else replies right away to say what they think. It's almost irrelevant whether it's to disagree or not. What matters is to make clear one’s position. To sort of mark the territory.

I don’t know if it’s the pervasive use of social networks or the daily exposure to more information than our brains can process. But I see an increasing need from everyone to raise their voice, as if they felt they’re not being listened to enough.

Perhaps it's the consequence of "a generational breeding ground of damaged people connected to their own reflection" as Enrique Bunbury sings in [Autos de Choque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8aqSMy7Jxw).

Either way, I miss moments like the ones I described above, in which one could talk about anything and the other person would just listen. Or maybe say only “I don’t know” or “I don’t agree, but I understand you”, and leave it at that.
