Here is a recap of all the books I read in 2019.

## ReWork: Change the Way You Work Forever
[ReWork](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) is about challenging all the traditional ways software companies seem to have embraced in terms of product development and management. It continues in the same line as [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real), a _very_ influential book in the early days of my career, but going a bit deeper and touching some new aspects.

Most of the ideas presented will be familiar, if not redundant, if you have been following Basecamp's [blog](https://signalvnoise.com/) since its early days. However, I think it's valuable to have them all collected in a single place for future reference.

## Remote: Office Not Required
[Remote: Office Not Required](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) is Basecamp's take on remote work. The book is divided in two big chunks. The first one explains why remote work is a solid and valid alternative and debunks the excuses that we've telling ourselves to not adopt it. The second part then gives plenty of sound advice for those brave enough to go remote first.

I found myself nodding at almost every statement while reading the book. It is a fantastic resource for diagnosing many of the problems we currently have in our offices and transitioning to a more modern workplace. On the other hand I feel they should have put more emphasis on the fact that working remotely requires a particular set of skills that takes time to develop.

## It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work
The last in Basecamp's trilogy about challenging the traditional workplace, [It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm) focuses this time on having a calm environment that maximises productivity and boosts both company sustainability and employee happiness.

As someone that has recently suffered from prolonged periods of stress, which eventually led to symptoms of [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout), I can't recommend these ideas enough. Insane competition, results maximisation and growth for the sake of growth (rampant capitalism anyone?) are having a harmful impact on how companies develop their culture and treat their employees. This books offers a reality check and encourages a different way of doing things.

## Outlander series
I liked the first season of Starz's [Outlander](https://www.starz.com/us/en/series/21796) so much that I decided to give the novels by Diana Gabaldon a try.

The first one, [Outlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(novel)), did not disappoint me. As far as I recall it is also the first long novel I read completely in English. I really enjoyed it and it helped me learn a fair amount of new non-technical vocabulary (including a wee bit of Scottish slang). For that reason I also felt I kept missing many nuances.

[Dragonfly in Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_in_Amber) continues in the same narrative style, this time bringing the reader along two parallel storylines. The transition between them is very smooth and the story kept me intrigued until the end.

The third book in the series, [Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_(novel)), is where I felt Diana Gabaldon started to change her narrative style. Suddenly meaningless situations were being described with an incredible level of detail, while key events in the story were dealt with very quickly. I found some of the passages actually boring, but I couldn't help coming back for the more exciting parts.

Finally, I am about to finish [Drums of Autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drums_of_Autumn). This one is probably the last one I will read from the series. If the writing style started to get a bit tedious in the third book, things did not get better in this one.

## Building Evolutionary Architectures
[Building Evolutionary Architectures](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures) is a collection of recommendations and techniques for building an architecture that enables incremental change.

The authors' take on the topic is not new strictly speaking. If you have followed the recent improvements in continuous delivery and are familiar with agile practices, specially regarding to testing, everything will sound familiar.

I found this book however more approachable than other similar works and I consider it a very nice introduction that invites you to keep researching using more advance material.

## Domain-Driven Design
Eric Evans' [Domain-Driven Design](https://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/) is the canonical work that introduced this approach to software development.

It is a long book and not really easy to read. But it's full of valid ideas to help you model a problem space in a useful and clean way. I learned the fundamentals of DDD on the job, but seeing them together in their context gave them an even more meaningful purpose.

## Modern Auto Layout
I bought [Modern Auto Layout](https://useyourloaf.com/autolayout/) in 2018 but I hadn't had a chance to read it until 2019. Most of the content was not new to me, but it gave me reassurance that I was understanding and doing things correctly.

The only aspect that it really helped me with was understanding the relationship between [layout guides](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilayoutguide), [layout margins](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622566-layoutmargins) and [safe areas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/2891102-safearealayoutguide), and how to leverage them to avoid unnecessary padding views.

## App Architecture
I could lay my hands on objc's [App Architecture](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/) after participating in a workshop at work. Rather than trying to recommend any particular architecture, the authors highlight the pros and cons of a collection of them. I'd argue it ends up revealing the flaws more than anything else, which I found really valuable.

Given that I share Dave Verwer's [opinion](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/445) that "â€¦there's no such thing [as a perfect architecture], and you'll waste endless time trying", I really liked this book.
