["Why Scrum Should Basically Just Die In A Fire"](https://archive.is/Rjqh0) is the title of an article written by [Giles Bowkett](https://twitter.com/gilesgoatboy) that caught my attention a few months ago. Among all the topics discussed, he suggested that the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) principle about face-to-face communication "might be to blame" for inspiring Scrum's [daily stand-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Daily_scrum).

The argument is that tools available at the time (2001) are not comparable with the ones that exist today. There is no reason anymore for encouraging face-to-face communication. Specially in the context of the stand-up, which often looks more like a [morning report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwBNlrv-_rs), rather than an "effective method of conveying information to and within a development team".

While I don't agree with all of Giles's points, because I believe face-to-face communication has a place, this paragraph resonated with me:

> *Well-written text very often trumps face-to-face communication. You can refer to well-written text later, instead of relying on your memory. You can't produce well-written text unless you think carefully. Also, technically speaking, you can literally never produce good code in the first place unless you produce well-written text.*

My colleagues complain sometimes that I rely too much on chat, emails and Jira comments (or any other project management tool) when I am working. It's true that I am a bit of an introvert, but that's not the reason.

Leaving the [issue with open offices](https://twitter.com/jochenWolters/status/718175220637392897) aside, I love to communicate in written format at work for three reasons:

1. It's asynchronous. I can choose to *ignore interruptions* and answer later if I am concentrated on something
2. It forces me to *write better*. If I want the person at the other end to understand me, I must organise and communicate my ideas clearly
3. Written text *stay around* and you can go back to them later. Spoken words are cheap and fade away fast

This might sound a bit radical, especially when you are sharing an office space with your team and going to someone's desk sounds like the most natural thing to do.

So taking things in balance, to what extent is writing an important resource in a developer's toolkit?


## The importance of good writing skills
Back in 2007 when I was doing my internship, I borrowed the [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com) book from my mentor. I learnt a lot from it and I think it contains really great advice for every company. On the [Wordsmiths](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths#hire-good-writers) chapter they talk about a curious hiring policy:

> *If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer. It doesnâ€™t matter if that person is a designer, programmer, marketer, salesperson, or whatever, the writing skills will pay off. Effective, concise writing and editing leads to effective, concise code, design, emails, instant messages, and more*

> *Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need.*

I took it like this: "if I want to be a good professional, I must be a good writer". Since then, I've been trying to improve my writing and communication skills. It takes time to get better and I keep making mistakes, but it has helped me a lot. Writing is an essential tool for developers because we spend most of our work time writing: code, documentation, user stories, bug reports, etc.

Let me give you another example. In [App Builders](https://www.appbuilders.ch) 2016 [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta) gave a great talk about going open-source in your company by default. One of things he mentioned was that working in that kind of projects made him a better writer because he had to:

- Write code that is going to be _read by others_
- Write documentation that is going to be _read by others_
- Create pull requests _explaining to others_ what the changes are about
- Report bugs describing what happens so that _others can understand_, understand and fix them

Did you notice the pattern above? Writing effectively is not about you. It's about communicating clearly and concisely so that others can understand.

You can argue that those skills are crucial in open-source projects because that's the way work is done; it's not that important when your team is in the same room. Maybe you're right. But I have found that frequently those were mere excuses to justify my laziness and lack of empathy for others.


## Finding the sweet spot
Face-to-face is _sometimes_ the faster and most efficient way to go. It can convey more information in extended discussions, which otherwise would turn into a mess (e.g. scrolling a hundred of chat messages). [Non-verbal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication) also helps understand the nuances of spoken words.

But don't underestimate the power of having good writing skills either. It helps you organise and communicate your ideas clearly. It helps everyone understand them. It reduces the need of interrupting others. And it helps you think twice before speaking whatever comes to mind at first. As a consequence, it helps you stand out as a professional.

As with most things in software development, the answer lies on finding the sweet spot. I personally favour writing over talking.
