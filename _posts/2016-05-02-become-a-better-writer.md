description: A friendly reminder about the importance of good writing skills

An [article claiming that *"Scrum is a mess"*](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.ch/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html) caught my attention a few months ago. Among all the topics discussed, this one seemed a bit overstated: blaming the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) principle about face-to-face communication for inspiring Scrum's [daily stand-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Daily_scrum).

<!--more-->

The claim is that tools available at that time (2001) are not comparable with the ones that exist today. There is no reason anymore for encouraging face-to-face communication. Specially in the context of the stand-up, which often looks more like a [morning report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71TN8NTtNBU), rather than an *"effective method of conveying information to and within a development team"*.

I do not agree 100% with [Giles Bowkett](https://twitter.com/gilesgoatboy)'s statements, because I do think that face-to-face communication definitely has its place (and I am pretty sure that he does too). But this paragraph resonated with me:

> *Well-written text very often trumps face-to-face communication. You can refer to well-written text later, instead of relying on your memory. You can't produce well-written text unless you think carefully. Also, technically speaking, you can literally never produce good code in the first place unless you produce well-written text.*

Then he gives the example of GitHub, known for having a [big remote team](https://github.com/about/team), which could not have succeeded without good communicators working together in a distributed environment.

So taking things in balance, to what extent is writing an important resource in a developer's toolkit?

## I admit it, I chat too much

My colleagues sometimes complain that I rely too much on chat when I am working. It is true that I am a bit of an introvert, but that is not the cause. Leaving the [issue with open offices](https://twitter.com/jochenWolters/status/718175220637392897) aside, I love to use chat on a daily basis for three reasons:

1. It is asynchronous. I can **choose to not be interrupted** and answer later if I am in [the zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Which is important if I want to get something done.
2. It forces me to **write better**. If I want the person at the other end to understand me, I have to organise and communicate my ideas clearly.
3. **Written text stay around**, spoken words go away. Like the article suggested, _"you can refer to well-written text later"_ if necessary.

That might seem a bit radical, especially when you are sharing an office space with your team. Then again, I think it is really expensive for a company to take developers out of the zone. And I do not buy the _"let's solve it face-to-face because it's going to be faster"_ argument. Sometimes it *really* is the faster and most efficient way. In my experience, however, it is often an excuse for saving some keystrokes and maybe a sign of not-so-good communication skills.

On the other hand, though, I acknowledge that there are also several downsides with my policy. [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) pointed all of them in his article about [abusing the group chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d).

With all that said, I would like to focus on the second point for the rest of this post.


## The importance of good writing skills

Back in 2007 when I was doing my internship, I borrowed the [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com) book from my mentor. I learnt a lot from it and I think it is still really good advice today. The [last section of chapter 8](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php) talks about a curious hiring policy:

> *If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer [...]*

> *[...] Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need.*

As an intern, I took it like this: _"if I want to be hired, I must be a good writer"_. Since then, I have been trying to improve my writing and communication skills. It takes time to get better, I have made the same mistakes over and over and I am not done yet. But eventually you learn what is effective if you pay attention to how people react.

And if you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. Writing is an essential tool for developers because... We spend most of our work time writing! Code, documentation, user stories, bug reports, etc. I heard someone saying once that _"good engineers write good documentation"_. I cannot agree more.

Now, I understand that for non-native English speakers it is incredibly difficult to reach a certain level of mastery. I struggle with it every day too (my native language is Spanish), but that is the world we live in. It is our duty to improve every day because it could also be a decisive factor when applying to the next job.


## An example from the world of open-source

I attended [App Builders](https://www.appbuilders.ch) 2016 last week, where [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta) gave a great talk about going open-source in your company by default. One of things he mentioned was that working in that kind of projects makes him a better writer, because he has to:

* Write code that is going to be read by a lot of people.
* Write documentation that is going to be read by a lot of people.
* Send pull-requests explaining clearly what is the contribution about.
* Report issues when something is not working as expected, detailing how to reproduce it.

You can argue that in the world of open-source such skills are crucial because the way work is done. You can say that when you are working with your team in the same room it is not that important. Maybe. But remember that [you play like you practice](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3504-you-play-like-you-practice).
